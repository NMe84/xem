# The Xross Entity Map for TV shows
XEM helps you keep an overview of your shows on different websites. Since many websites use different ways of numbering shows, seasons and episodes and naming them XEM attempts to link each of these entities together in a meaningful way.

XEM provides an API that external services can use to match episodes between different websites, which allows for matching data from one website to that of another.

You do not need to run your own copy of XEM. It's a web service that is completely free to use. This repository mainly exists to stimulate feature contributions. We will accept pull requests that we deem useful.
